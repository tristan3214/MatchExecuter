    the default zcombine command to run here is "zcombine -bestonly fit_name > fit_name.zc".  A user can inherit this class and manually
    change this command to something more complicated.  There is also a script the user can specfiy that will run at the very end.  An example
    of such a script could be plotting the SFH after the fit completes.
